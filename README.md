**Goal :**
The goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting housing prices based on various features. By deploying this model as a Flask API, we aim to provide real-time predictions to users. Additionally, integrating TensorBoard for monitoring allows for continuous tracking of model performance and training metrics, ensuring the model remains reliable and effective over time. This project also demonstrates the use of modern cloud platforms for scalable and efficient deployment of machine learning solutions.

**Approach :**

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Source: Gather housing data from sources such as Kaggle or real estate databases.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct any inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing data to improve model performance.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model.

2. Model Development
   
Algorithm Selection: Choose an appropriate regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
Model Training: Train the model using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

3. Flask API Development
   
API Setup: Create a Flask application to serve the model.
Endpoints: Develop API endpoints for predictions, model updates, and health checks.
Input Validation: Ensure the API validates input data and handles errors appropriately.
Testing: Test the API endpoints to ensure they are reliable and accurate.

4. TensorBoard Integration
   
Logging: Integrate TensorBoard to log training metrics such as loss, accuracy, and custom metrics.
Visualization: Use TensorBoard's dashboard to visualize and monitor training progress in real-time.

5. Deployment and Monitoring
   
Containerization (Optional): Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment.
Cloud Deployment: Deploy the Flask API on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
Monitoring: Set up monitoring and logging to track API performance, request handling, and potential issues.
Auto-scaling: Implement auto-scaling and load balancing to handle varying traffic loads efficiently.

6. Maintenance and Updates
Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor the API and model performance.
Model Updates: Update the model periodically with new data to maintain accuracy.
Bug Fixes: Address any bugs or issues that arise during the usage of the API.
